            This website will contain a blog; which will show readers my journey; in addition to showing readers many of the skills I have developed throughout my training. During the next 6 months, you will see this website change, from what it is now ( a basic and unattractive website; using only HTML and CSS) to a professional lookin website, using modern technologies, and giving employers/clients the o[pportunity to see what I can do.

            <em>About me;</em> I'm a late 30's ex secondfary school teacher turn web-developer.<br>
            <br>I decided to leave the teaching profession last year and turn my skill set to a new challenge. That challenge was web development.
            So far; I've enjoyed every minute of transition from secondfary school teacher to a full time developer.<br>

            I've always had a entreprenuerial flair; when I was in my early 30's I set up a small private tutoring company; providing maths, economics, business studies tuition to students across London.
            I hope to put my entreprenurial skills to good use, along with my ever increasing web-development skill set.

            I enjoy travelling (some of my photos are attached to this site) reading, blues, jazz, 80's, 90's music.
